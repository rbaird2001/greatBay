# greatBay
Node Based CLI Auction App

## Description
I got to a usable stage on the Great Bay app from class on Wednesday, Sept. 18. It's not perfect. Some prompts do nothing, most notably selection a category of items to bid. Still, it does work and has code that might be helpful for the homework assignment.
The main file is greatBay.js. It needs to be configured for your database password.

There is also a sql script to build the greatbay database used by the script. It will create a new database named greatBay and build three tables, although only one is used at present.  The used table is bidItems. I may look into implementing the others later. For now, I must be satisfied with this progress and focus on the homework assignment.

The script also adds 4 items for bidding. This should give you the ability to test the process.
